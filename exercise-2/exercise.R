### Retrieve values from your data frame to answer the following questions
### Note that you should get the value as specific as possible (e.g., a single
### cell rather than the whole row!)

# What was the 2015 salary of employee 57
salaries[5,]

# How many employees got a raise?
nrows(got.raise = T)

# What was the value of the highest raise?


# What was the "name" of the employee who received the highest raise?


# What was the largest decrease in salaries between the two years?


# What was the name of the employee who recieved largest decrease in salary?

# What was the average salary increase?


### Bonus ###

# Write a .csv file of your salaries to your working directory


# For people who did not get a raise, how much money did they lose?


# Is that what you expected them to lose based on how you generated their salaries?
